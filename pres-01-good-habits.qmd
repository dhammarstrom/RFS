## [Good habits:]{.yellow} Are not part of your course portfolio! {.smaller}

- Create and maintain documentation, start with README
- Identify one weakness in your workflow, improve and proceed with the next <!-- Karl Broman --> 
- Share your data
- Share your code
- Name files in a consistent way <!--  --->
- Stay as true as possible to a style guide
- Be lazy! Try to minimize your code (refactor when possible)

- Refactor code <!-- https://datasemantics.co/15-habits-of-highly-effective-data-scientists/  -->
- Reanalyze data sets <!-- Andrew Gelman https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/10/04/you-can-learn-a-lot-from-reanalyzing-data-signing-at-the-beginning-example-but-also-many-others/ -->
- Every operation in your project should be scripted <!-- Karl Broman "everything with a script" -->
- Simulate! <!-- Statistical rethinking among others -->
- Convert scripts and repeated code into functions <!-- Broman et al -->
- Document functions as part of packages <!-- Broman et al -->
- Document data
- Use version control
- Comment your code!
- Compartmentalize analyses, small scripts, incremental steps.
