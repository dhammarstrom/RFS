# Version control and collaborative scientific coding
Reproducibility and transparency are aspects of scientific research practices that have great potential to affect the quality of scientific results. Quality in the sense that results to a larger degree will be available for critical dissemination by independent researchers, founding agencies and the public. As scientists we have a moral obligation to be transparent, and having transparency as a goal will likely make us better scientist.

In this workshop to we will introduce version control in the context of collaborative scientific writing. Version control software allows researchers to automate the process of keeping a record of changes to a project. It could also show whom made contributions. Changing your mindset to focus on the process (researching/communicating) rather than one end product (a thesis/paper) may change how you think about the scientific process.

Collaboration around complex projects is messy.
